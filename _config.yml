title: Hi!
description: Welcome to my page. I am Miruna and I am currently oursuing my PhD at UCL in Interdesciplinary Biosciences. I am currently in my rotations year, which means I get to explore and combine really cool areas of science. For example I spent the last few months using Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Machine Learning to find antimicrobial peptides. Now you can find me modelling kids and adults brain using fNIRs(functional near infra-red spectroscopy) and bNIRs(broadband near-infrared spectroscopy.
