### About me
Hi! I am Miruna and I am a LIDo PhD student in Interdesciplinary Biosciences at University College London. I am currently in my first year when I am required to complete two rotations, which means I get to explore and combine really cool areas of science. For example I spent the last few months using Molecular Dynamics simulations and Machine Learning to find antimicrobial peptides. Now you can find me modelling the brain using fNIRs(functional near infra-red spectroscopy) and bNIRs(broadband near-infrared spectroscopy).

### Science, tech & stuff
I am a biochemist turned bioinformatician turned data engineer turned ... mmm ... techientist ... scientechist ?
Even though I've always been drawn to science, programming and tech has rapidly gained a huge part of my heart. And because I don't want to give up any of them, here I am, trying to understand science one line of code at a time.

Here's some stuff I have experience working on/with:

 1. __Computational Biology__
    * metagenomic analysis (see my BSc thesis work [https://github.com/miruuna/Metagenomics])
    * antibodies repertoires (see my MSc thesis work [https://github.com/miruuna/comparison-of-epitopes-and-paratopes])
    * Molecular Dynamics simulation and analysis of bacterial membranes (see the work for my 1st rotation of my PhD [https://github.com/miruuna/MD_scripts_membrane_lipids])
    * fNIRs, bNIRs and mathematical modelling of the brain
 2. __Dev__
    * Python - proficient
    * Java - beginner (see the FairGrade Calculator I coded for a JAVA programming module I took during my undergrad [https://github.com/miruuna/ProjectJava])
    * SQL - medium
    * Matlab - medium
    * R - beginner
    * Bash scripting - proficient
    * __tools__
      * Django
      * Dockerisation
      * API development
      * ETL processes
      * Continuous integration and deployment using Bamboo and Travis
      * Version control using git
      * Azure
