### About me
Hi! I am Miruna and I am a LIDo PhD student in Interdesciplinary Biosciences at University College London. I am currently in my first year when I am required to complete two rotations, which means I get to explore and combine really cool areas of science. For example I spent the last few months using Molecular Dynamics simulations and Machine Learning to find antimicrobial peptides. Now you can find me modelling the brain using fNIRs(functional near infra-red spectroscopy) and bNIRs(broadband near-infrared spectroscopy).

### Science, tech & stuff
I am a biochemist turned bioinformatician turned data engineer turned ... mmm ... techientist ... scientechist ?
Even though I've always been drawn to science, programming and tech has rapidly gained a huge part of my heart. And because I don't want to give up any of them, here I am, trying to understand science one line of code at a time.
